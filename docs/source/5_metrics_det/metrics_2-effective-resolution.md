## EKE power spectrum


The Power Spectrum is used to analyze the energy content of the oceanic current field. Specifically, the EKE (Eddy Kinetic Energy) power spectrum is computed, which describes the distribution of kinetic energy at different spatial scales (k).

$$ E(k) = \sum _k {EKE(k) e^{i2\pi k}}$$

Understanding the EKE power spectrum helps identify the currents energy repartition in space, thus, highlighting dominant features and scales of motion in the ocean.
