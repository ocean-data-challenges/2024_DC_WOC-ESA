- **GlobCurrent total** 

    The GlobCurrent data repository now includes the surface geostrophic current, the Ekman current at the surface and at 15 m depth, and the combined geostrophic and Ekman currents. The data are interpolated and collocated to a common grid with a spatial resolution of 25 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day for the geostrophic current and three hours for the Ekman currents and the combined currents. It covers the 23-year period from January 1993 to May 2016. A regional product for the Mediterranean Sea interpolated to a spatial resolution of 1/8 degree and a temporal resolution of 3 hours is also available.

- **GlobCurrent Geostrophic** 

    Altimeter satellite gridded Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year [1993, 2012] mean. The SLA is estimated by Optimal Interpolation, merging the L3 along-track measurement from the different altimeter missions available. Part of the processing is fitted to the Global Ocean. (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (i.e. Absolute Dynamic Topography and geostrophic currents (absolute and anomalies)). It serves in near-real time applications. This product is processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system.
