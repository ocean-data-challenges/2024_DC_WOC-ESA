# DUACS geostrophic currents  

<br>

Altimeter satellite gridded Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year [1993, 2012] mean. The SLA is estimated by Optimal Interpolation, merging the L3 along-track measurement from the different altimeter missions available. Part of the processing is fitted to the Global Ocean. (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (i.e. Absolute Dynamic Topography and geostrophic currents (absolute and anomalies)). It serves in near-real time applications. This product is processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system.
