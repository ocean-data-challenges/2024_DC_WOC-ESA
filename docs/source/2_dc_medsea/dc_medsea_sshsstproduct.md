# WOC - Merged SSH/SST currents  

<br>

This dataset provides a level 4 (L4) gap free reconstruction of 2D ocean surface currents obtained through the combination of altimeter-derived geostrophic currents and satellite sea surface temperature (SST) L4 data. This WOC product uses the standard Altimeter-derived geostrophic currents (Copernicus operational product, ¼°) as background information and extracts additional dynamical information from the spatial and temporal gradients of a higher-resolution (HR) satellite-derived SST field (Copernicus OSTIA product, remapped onto a 1/10° grid). In particular, the patterns found in the HR satellite SST enable to compute correction factors that are assigned to the background geostrophic currents provided by the Altimeter system.
