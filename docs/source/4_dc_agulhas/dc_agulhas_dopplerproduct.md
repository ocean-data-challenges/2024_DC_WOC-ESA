# WOC - Doppler currents  

<br>

This dataset contains calibrated Sentinel-1 IW SAR Doppler frequency shift and waves bias estimates required for retrieving ocean surface current radial velocity, combined with wind from ECMWF and Stokes drift from the WW3 in the south-west Indian ocean (Agulhas current).
