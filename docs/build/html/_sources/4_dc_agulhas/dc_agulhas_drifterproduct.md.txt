# WOC - Drifter data-driven currents 

<br>

This dataset provides Level 4 total current including geostrophy and a data-driven approach for Ekman and near-inertial current, based on a convolution between drifter observation and wind history, to fit empirically a complex and time-lag dependant transfert function between ERA5 wind stress and current
