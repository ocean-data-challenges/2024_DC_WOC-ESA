- **OSCAR** 

    Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-time (OSCAR) is a global surface current database and NASA funded research project. OSCAR ocean mixed layer velocities are calculated from satellite-sensed sea surface height gradients, ocean vector winds, and sea surface temperature gradients using a simplified physical model for geostrophy, Ekman, and thermal wind dynamics. Daily averaged surface currents are provided on a global 0.25 x 0.25 degree grid as an average over an assumed well-mixed top 30 m of the ocean from 1993 to present day. OSCAR currents are provided at three quality levels: final, interim and nrt with a respective latency of each of approximately 1 year, 1 month, and 2 days. OSCAR is generated by Earth & Space Research (ESR) https://www.esr.org/research/oscar/.

- **NeurOST** 

    This Daily NeurOST Level 4 Sea Surface Height and Surface Geostrophic Currents analysis product from the University of Washington and JPL was mapped by a neural network trained with sparse Level 3 nadir altimetry observations (CMEMS, E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information) and the MUR Level 4 gridded sea surface temperature product (PO.DAAC).
