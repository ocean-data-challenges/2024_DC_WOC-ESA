- **CLS: MIOST** 
 

    Multi-scale interpolation (MIOST) combines ocean altimetry data along the track into continuous grids in time and space. Like the DUACS mapping system, it is based on a linear optimal interpolation scheme, with a different level of definition of the covariance functions. For this experimental product, only covariance functions representative of mesoscale geostrophic variability have been taken into account.
